# wirelessprocess
You can see the processes of the server wireless from the same network This is an django project you need to install django

To refresh the working services you need start SVCAPP/templates/SVCAPP/output.py indepented

To run it in this directory open terminal and type "python manage.py 192.168.0.1:port"

The systems work like this --> 
when django works it renders svc.html it is a ui but when i press the link it it redirects to output.html this file controlled by output.py it refreshed every 10 second the processes and you can see from your network

You need to change ips (type ipconfig to terminal and get ipv4 adress) and the link in svc.html if need help contact me
